# Covid-Case-Prediction-Netherlands

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data used in the thesis project titled "Enhancing Predictive Models for COVID-19: A Case Study of the Netherlands." The study aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of predictive models for COVID-19 case trends, contributing valuable insights for future public health strategies.

## Context and Importance of the Study
The COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as one of the most devastating global health crises of the modern era. Since its onset in late 2019, it has rapidly spread across the globe, significantly impacting nearly every country. As of current standings, the pandemic has resulted in more than 7 million deaths worldwide, with approximately 23,000 of those occurring in the Netherlands ([source](https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/deaths?m49=528&n=o)). This unprecedented public health emergency has not only strained healthcare systems but has also induced severe economic disruptions and social instability.

The scale and speed of COVID-19's impact underscore the critical need for effective predictive models that can aid in managing such pandemics. Furthermore, experts suggest that the frequency of pandemic-level outbreaks may increase due to factors such as global connectivity and ecological changes ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9175207/)). Therefore, developing robust forecasting tools is essential for preparing and responding to future infectious disease outbreaks. This study aims to address this urgent need by enhancing the accuracy and reliability of predictive models for COVID-19, contributing valuable insights that could shape future public health strategies.

## Societal and Scientific Relevance
The ability to accurately predict the spread of COVID-19 is not merely an academic exercise; it is a critical component of public health strategy that can directly influence life-saving policy decisions. This research is poised to deliver significant societal benefits by enabling better anticipation of virus spread, which can guide the timing and scale of interventions such as lockdowns, vaccination drives, and resource allocations. Effective predictive models support public health officials in making informed decisions that can minimize the pandemic's impact on the population and healthcare systems.

Scientifically, this thesis advances the field of epidemiological modeling by employing a blend of traditional statistical methods and innovative machine learning techniques, such as a novel machine learning framework, Chronos ([source](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.07815v1)), which promises superior performance over existing models. The exploration of multiple predictive models in this context addresses a gap in current research regarding the integration and comparative effectiveness of various modeling approaches for infectious disease forecasting. This study not only enhances our understanding of COVID-19 dynamics but also lays a foundation for handling future pandemics, as it contributes to the body of knowledge on how different data sources and modeling techniques can be synthesized to improve forecast accuracy.

## Methodology
This study leverages six unique datasets across six different models, spanning various time periods to provide a comprehensive analysis of the pandemic. The datasets include:
- General COVID-19 data
- Policy interventions
- Mobility trends
- Public interest metrics
- Temperature variations
- COVID-19 variant information

The research utilizes six diverse predictive models:
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Gaussian Processes (GP)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
- CHRONOS framework

Each model is selected for its particular strengths in addressing the complex data challenges presented by the pandemic. The selection and application of these models are elaborated upon extensively in the methodology section of the thesis.

## Research Questions
The central research question addressed in this thesis is:
**How effectively can various predictive models, incorporating multiple datasets, forecast COVID-19 case trends in the Netherlands?**

To thoroughly address this main question, the research is structured around four subquestions:
1. **Model Comparison:** How do ARIMA, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models compare in their forecasting accuracy for COVID-19 cases in the Netherlands, considering different time periods?
2. **Dataset Integration Impact:** What impact does the inclusion of diverse datasets have on the predictive performance of these models?
3. **Factor Analysis:** Which factors are most influential in enhancing the predictive accuracy of the best-performing models?
4. **Broader Applications:** How can the methodologies developed for COVID-19 case forecasting be adapted to predict other pandemic-related outcomes, such as death rates within the country?
